## Faker for Pattern Lab-Node

This is a plugin that adds Faker data to your `data.json` file at build time.

## Install

`npm install --save plugin-node-faker`

(Remember to run `NPM run postinstall` in your Pattern Lab base directory.)

## Usage

In `data.json`, add Faker API methods as strings. Call the vars as you normally would inside Mustache (untested with other PL engines).

```
{
  "company" : {
    "name" : "faker.name.findName",
    "url" : "faker.internet.url"
  }
}
```

## Some common Faker API methods

```
@faker.[SECTION].[PROPERTY]([OPTIONS])@ // `options` and parenthesis are optional
@faker.name.findName@ // returns 'Neal Considine'
@faker.name.firstName@ // returns 'Jaron'
@faker.name.lastName@ // returns 'Will'
@faker.internet.url@ // returns 'https://heath.org'
@faker.lorem.paragraph@ // returns paragraph
@faker.lorem.words(5)@ // returns 5 words
@faker.lorem.text(500)@ // returns random number of characters less than 500. Could be 20 chars. Could be 200.
```

Check out Faker on NPM for all the different API methods (https://www.npmjs.com/package/faker). I've found Marak's Github wiki to be a little more detailed though (https://github.com/Marak/Faker.js/wiki).

## Work in process

A tale of two listeners. For some reason, I can't update the listitems object and the pattern-specific data object with one listener. `data.json` doesn't care where it's changed, but these other two get operated on in different places.
